# This repository uses Random Forest to predict Turbulent Diffusivity in K-Profile Parameterization.

- **Random-Forest-Model.ipynb**: This notebook contains the code for predicting turbulent diffusivity. It compares the performance of four different Random Forest models.
  
- **Predicting-Max-Diffusivity.ipynb**: This notebook includes a Random Forest model that predicts only the maximum diffusivity and the depth at which it occurs.

- **Feature-Selection-for-Max-Diffusivity.ipynb**: This notebook performs feature selection using Random Forest's feature importance and the `sklearn.feature_selection` module to evaluate the significance of each feature in predicting maximum diffusivity and its depth.
